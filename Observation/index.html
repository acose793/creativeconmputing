            <h6>Map a Journey</h6>

            <h2>Observation</h2>
    		
            <p>The journey from my house to university is a brief but very loud one. Theres never a quiet moment. I live in midtown, near Time Square and so everything around me is fast, loud and bright, with a lot pf people passing by. I see Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and the Empire State Building every time. I also see a lot of food establishments, like McDonalds, pizzerias, Chipotle and Starbucks, two times, because one around the block is apparently not enough. Theres the hotness and the strong grill smell of the HALAL food trucks, the sweet sound of the Ice Cream Trucks and the radio music coming out of those New York souvenir shops that are seen all around the city. When I pass all of this, I arrive at Herald Square, an intersection filled with huge billboards and ads, updating me with whats going on around the world. I see the Macy’s window displays everyday, they adorn the whole street. Recently, the Christmas displays have started to emerge, they come along with music, slightly cheering the long walk until reaching the subway station. In the station, I take the Q train that rapidly takes me to Union Square. The park is full of different things going on, people skating, school trips, performers, sellers, Buddhists and people just rushing to get to their destination on time. The journey from the park to school, is again, filled with noise and visuals. More HALAL cars, shops and cafe’s. Theres a market which displays their fresh fruits and vegetables outside. Its a nice and contrasting view compared to the surroundings. Around the block, a lot of other New School, Pratt and NYU students are seen also rushing towards their classes. The New School building is a very compelling site, occupying half of the street, with its glass structure grabbing the attention of anyone who passes by. Due to the destination of the journey, I’m always rushing, they only times I soak up my surroundings is when I get out class, no longer with the pressure if I’m gonna arrive late or not. My journey is accompanied by the music I hear with my headphones, making more enjoyable and less stressful. It feels like if a lot of of things are happening at once, I overhear various conversations, see all kinds of people, its something new everyday.</p>
