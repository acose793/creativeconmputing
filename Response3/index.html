            <h2>How does changing the typography of an iconic logotype such as Google, affect the way people think of the company, especially when drastic changes are being made?</h2>
    		
            <p>The logotype of a company is like the equivalent of a person's face in real life. Its the first thing that comes up in the mind of a person when the name of such company is said out loud. It visualizes not only its name, but its whole identity and it gives the company a certain personality and image with distance traits. Subconsciously, it does more than we think. So when its identity is changed by a simple action as chasing its typography, its creates an almost uncomfortable and unfamiliar feeling. Like a shift on reality. The company loses sense of what it is, the feeling it once evoked no longer lingers.</p>
