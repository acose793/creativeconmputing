<em>What attained glitter graphics their popularity?</em>
<br>
<br>


During the earlier years of the internet, everything was sort of “new” and “innovative,” just like real-world technology. At the time, glitter graphics mimicked something that already popular during that time in the real-world—which was, evidently, glitter. Glitter nails, makeup, and clothing were all in its prime. The author, Lialina says how here daughter “thinks that glittery graphics is the same thing as glittery stickers (only digital).” I believe the implementation of something seen in real-life, to the digital world was something that amazed audiences back then. As their usage increased, glitter graphics generators started to emerged, which further amplified people interest on them, this time you could customize your graphics, make them your own and start your internet brand. Lialina also mentions another real-world trend that further backed up the popularity of glitter graphics, which was the “pimp pop culture”, so the graphics not only appeased to a certain group, but a wider, diverse audience. Specifically during 2007, glitter graphics took over MySpace profiles, homepages and even web browsers, becoming a symbol of our digital times.
